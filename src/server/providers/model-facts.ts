// v11 entry written by the PR's preview build would drop every Azure row.
// v13: MiniMax M2 rows store no maxOutput (the spec maximum is the context
// window). A v12 entry would keep 204800 on them for six hours.
// v14: Gemini and Mistral model pages gain `modalities`. A v13 entry has
// none, and the schema walk that used to fill the field no longer does.
// v15: open fill-gaps PRs #242 and #244. Do not reuse.
// v16: Mistral model pages gain maxOutput and page pricing, and the pricing
// doc stores the table without those pages. A v14 entry would keep Large 4's
// sale row skipped and leave the new fields null for six hours.
// v21: Azure rows gain effort lists, request maps, and the gpt-4 /

// v22: DashScope compat cache includes `scope`. A v21 entry has no scope,
// so a chat id the page does not name would still get the compat map.
// v23: Gemini's cached index is `{url, ids}` rows, thinking pages cache
// budget bodies, and model pages cache per-id sections. Thinking-level
// `mandatory` is true only when the page says that family cannot turn
// thinking off. A v22 entry has none of that, so Gemini facts read from
// it would stay null or mark every level column mandatory.
// v24: Cerebras model pages include paid maxOutput. A v23 entry has no
// maxOutput and would leave it null for six hours.
// v25: Bedrock cards gain request maps, feature flags, and price-list
// rates. A v24 entry would leave those null for six hours.
// v26: Together reasoning pages and the serverless chat catalog cache
// plain records. A v25 entry stored Maps, which JSON reads back as {},
