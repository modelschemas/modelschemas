# Deep Thinking

Deep Thinking is an advanced reasoning feature that enables Chain of Thought mechanisms, allowing the model to perform deep analysis and reasoning before answering questions. This approach significantly improves the model's accuracy and interpretability in complex tasks, particularly suitable for scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning, logical analysis, and problem-solving.

## Features

The Deep Thinking feature currently supports the latest models in the GLM-5.3, GLM-5.3-FLASH, GLM-5.2, GLM-5.1, GLM-5, GLM-4.5, GLM-4.6, GLM-4.7 series. By enabling deep thinking, the model can:

* **Multi-step Reasoning**: Break down complex problems into multiple steps for gradual analysis and resolution
* **Logical Analysis**: Provide clear reasoning processes and logical chains
* **Improved Accuracy**: Reduce errors and improve answer quality through deep thinking
* **Enhanced Interpretability**: Display the thinking process to help users understand the model's reasoning logic
* **Intelligent Judgment**: The model automatically determines whether deep thinking is needed to optimize response efficiency

### Core Parameters

Note: GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.3-FLASH no longer support disabling thinking (an error will occur if the `thinking.type` parameter in the API request is set to `disabled`). Please ensure that thinking is enabled.

* **`thinking.type`**: Controls the deep thinking mode
  * `enabled` (default): Enable dynamic thinking. The model automatically determines whether to think: `GLM-5.2`, `GLM-5.1`, `GLM-5`, `GLM-4.6`, and `GLM-4.5` auto-decide whether to think, while `GLM-5.3`, `GLM-5.3-FLASH`, `GLM-4.7` and `GLM-4.5V` use forced thinking
  * `disabled`: Disable deep thinking, provide direct answers
* **`reasoning_effort`**: Controls the degree of reasoning within the thought chain, and is only supported by `GLM-5.2` and above.
  * Available values: `max` (default and recommended, deep inference), `high` (enhanced inference), `low` (mild inference, only supported by GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.3-FLASH)
  * In the API request:
  * * For GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.3-FLASH, only `max`, `high` and `low` are supported. Any other input will result in an error.
  * * For GLM-5.2, the supported options are `max` (default and recommended, for deep inference), `xhigh`, `high` (enhanced inference), `medium`, `low`, `minimal`, and `none`. Among them, `none` or `minimal` indicate that the model stops thinking; `low`/`medium` are mapped to `high`; `xhigh` is mapped to `max`.
  * In the Coding Plan request:
  * * For GLM-5.3 and GLM-5.3-FLASH, `none`, `minimal`, and `low` are mapped to `low`; `medium`, `high` are mapped to `high`; `xhigh` and `max` are mapped to `max`.
  * * For GLM-5.2, `none` or `minimal` indicate that the model stops thinking; `low` / `medium` are mapped to `high`; `xhigh` is mapped to `max`.
* **`model`**: A model that enables deep thinking, supported by `GLM-4.5` and above versions.

## Notes

1. **Response time**：Different reasoning effort levels will increase response time, particularly for complex tasks
2. **Token consumption**：Thinking process will consume extra tokens, please manage your tokens
3. **Model support**：Ensure you're using models that support deep thinking
4. **Task matching**：Choose whether to enable deep thinking according to the task complexity
5. **Streaming output**：Combine streaming output to see the thinking process, improving user experience
