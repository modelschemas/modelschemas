 * A fetch that leaves Cloudflare from eastern North America (issue #356).
 *
 * Anthropic and Gemini refuse callers in regions they do not serve
 * (`403 forbidden` / `400 User location is not supported`). Cron
 * invocations run wherever Cloudflare has spare capacity, and `placement`
 * only moves fetch handlers, so the models poll has no fixed location.
 * A Durable Object is created near its `locationHint` on the first `get()`
 * and does not move afterwards, so routing the keyed listing calls through
 * one fixes where they egress. Docs loads go the same way: Anthropic's
 * docs host serves pages with no tables to the regions its API refuses
 * (#482), and OpenAI's docs host answers 403 from hkg1 (#505). (The `us`
 * jurisdiction would be a hard guarantee, but workerd does not implement
 * it, so `bun run dev` would throw.)
 *
 * Outside the Workers runtime (bun scripts, node unit tests) there is no
 * binding and the global fetch runs from the caller's own machine. Inside
 * it, a missing binding is a config error and throws.
