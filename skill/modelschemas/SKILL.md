description: Live AI model schema service. Use when asked about a "model schema", "what models support X", "validate this provider payload", which AI models exist right now (availability, context windows, modalities, pricing, capabilities) across OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, xAI Grok, ElevenLabs, OpenRouter, FAL, or BytePlus, or the request/response shape of a provider endpoint.

# modelschemas

A live HTTP service answering: which AI models exist right now, what are
their capabilities, and what exactly do their request/response payloads look
like? Data refreshes automatically (model lists every 15 minutes, full spec
syncs daily), so prefer it over training-data knowledge for model
availability and schema questions.

## Workflow

1. **Discover.** `GET {base}/v1` lists every endpoint;
   `GET {base}/.well-known/agent-configuration` is the agent-auth discovery
   document; `GET {base}/openapi.json` is the typed spec.
2. **Read without auth.** All reads are public at a low rate limit (60/h per
   IP). Go straight to:
   - `GET /v1/models?activity=chat&q=claude` — what can I use right now.
     A row's `capabilities` is a map: `true` = the provider states
     support, `false` = it states none, key absent = unknown (never read a
     missing key as false). `?capability=tools` keeps rows where it is true.
   - `GET /v1/schemas` — every schema on the system
     (provider → activity → endpoint ids)
   - `GET /v1/schemas/{provider}` — endpoint ids per activity
   - `GET /v1/schemas/{provider}/{activity}/{endpointId}?kind=input` — a
     self-contained JSON Schema (URL-encode slashes in endpoint ids:
     `chat%2Fcompletions`). A listed model rawId also works as
     `{endpointId}` on grain=provider catalogs.
   - `GET /v1/openapi/{provider}` — connectable generation OpenAPI
     (FAL, currently the only model-grained provider, requires `?model=`)
3. **Authenticate for more** (5k req/h + webhooks). Easiest: the CLI —
   `modelschemas login` (agent-auth, autonomous mode, keys stored locally)
   or `modelschemas login --api-key`. Raw HTTP alternative:
   `POST /v1/agents/register-key {"name":"my-agent"}` returns a bearer key
   once.
4. **Validate before you spend tokens.**
   `POST /v1/validate {"provider","endpointId","payload"}` →
   `{valid, errors:[{path,message,keyword}]}` — or
   `modelschemas validate anthropic/v1/messages payload.json` (exit 2 when
   invalid).
5. **Estimate cost.** `POST /v1/estimate {"provider","model","request"?,"usage"?}`
   → `{amount, currency, usd?, cardSource, estimated, defaulted, ignored}`.
   `amount` is in `currency` (ISO 4217, mostly USD; never converted) and
   `usd` repeats it only for a USD card. `estimated` names any omitted
   usage the card filled by the source's published estimate method (empty:
   billed price). `defaulted` names omitted inputs that took the card's
   default; `ignored` names request keys the card does not read. Missing
   levers → 422; a usage key the card does not read → 422
   `unknown_usage_key`; no card → 404 `unknown_pricing`. `usage` is
   the provider's own usage object (OpenAI Responses or Chat, Anthropic,
   Gemini `usageMetadata`) or card levers whose counts do not overlap
   (`input_tokens` excludes `cache_read_tokens`), never both → 422
   `mixed_usage`. "Estimate usage" below maps each native field. CLI: `modelschemas estimate openai gpt-4o usage.json`.
6. **Stay current.** Poll `GET /v1/changes?since=<epoch>` (cursor-paginated)
   or subscribe: `POST /v1/subscriptions` (authed) delivers HMAC-signed
   webhooks for model/schema changes.

## CLI quick reference

```
modelschemas login [--delegated|--api-key]   # register this machine
modelschemas whoami                          # identity, grants, usage
modelschemas models list --activity chat --q claude
modelschemas models get openrouter anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5
modelschemas schema get anthropic v1/messages --kind input
modelschemas validate anthropic/v1/messages payload.json
modelschemas estimate openai gpt-4o usage.json
modelschemas changes --since 1781150000
modelschemas subscribe https://my.app/hook --events model.added
```

Every command prints JSON (pretty in a TTY, compact when piped).

## MCP

The service is also an MCP server: streamable HTTP at `{base}/mcp` with
tools `list_models`, `get_model`, `get_schema`, `validate_payload`,
`estimate_cost`, `recent_changes`. OpenAPI assembly is HTTP-only
(`GET /v1/openapi/{provider}`); MCP has no equivalent tool.

# modelschemas

Live AI model schema service. Per-endpoint request/response JSON Schemas and
model metadata for 30+ monitored providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, xAI
Grok, Mistral, Groq, DeepSeek, and more — GET /v1/providers for the full
roster), refreshed automatically: model lists every 15 minutes, full OpenAPI
spec syncs daily. Responses are JSON unless noted (`text/typescript`,
`application/openapi+json`).

## Why use this

- Discover which models exist *right now*, across providers, by activity
  (chat, image, video, audio, embeddings, moderation). Grain=provider
  catalogs (Grok, OpenAI, …) set `activity` on each row and
  `schemaEndpointId` pointing at the shared generation route
  (`v1/images/generations`, `images/generations`, …). `pricing` is a
  RateCard (or null when no price is stored). List rows carry a summary:
  `{currency, per: 'token', inputPerMillion, outputPerMillion, tiered?}`
  at the base rate, or `{currency, per: 'second' | 'character' | 'image' | …}`
  for a card billed by unit. `currency` is ISO 4217 (mostly USD; nothing
  is converted, so compare only like with like); `?pricing=1` returns
  the full card. `/v1/status` counts live `priced` models per provider
  and scores `completeness` (the share of chat facts filled; `score` is
  null with no chat models). A provider there carries `docsFailing`,
  `priceClearsRefused`, or `updateStorm` while its stored docs facts or
  prices may be stale, or one poll rewrote most of its live rows.
- Fetch a self-contained JSON Schema (refs bundled under $defs) for any
  provider generation endpoint — request (input) and response (output).
  A listed model rawId also works as `{endpointId}`: it aliases onto that
  route and pins the request `model` field to the one id.
- Validate a payload server-side before spending tokens on a provider call.
- Estimate the cost of a call from the stored rate card, in the card's
  currency (`POST /v1/estimate`).
- Poll /v1/changes (or subscribe via webhooks) to hear about new models and
  API revisions.

## Quickstart (no auth needed for reads)

1. GET /v1 — endpoint index.
2. GET /v1/models?activity=chat — cross-provider catalog of chat models.
3. GET /v1/schemas — system-wide index: every provider's activities and
   endpoint ids in one response (all schemas on the system).
4. GET /v1/schemas/anthropic — activities + endpoint ids for one provider.
5. GET /v1/schemas/anthropic/chat/{endpointId}?kind=input — the JSON Schema
   for a request body (endpoint ids contain slashes; URL-encode them).
   Grain=provider models also accept the raw id:
   `/v1/schemas/grok/image/grok-imagine-image-2.0?kind=input`.
6. GET /v1/openapi/{provider} — generation-only OpenAPI (servers, auth,
   paths). FAL requires ?model=. Over 40 endpoints, or a filter that
   matches none: 400 spec_requires_selector. HTTP only (no MCP tool).
7. POST /v1/validate {"provider","endpointId","payload"} — check a payload.
8. POST /v1/estimate {"provider","model","request"?,"usage"?} — {amount,
   currency} for a call from the stored rate card. Missing levers → 422;
   no card → 404 unknown_pricing. See "Estimate usage" below.
9. GET /v1/changes?since=<unix epoch> — what changed.

## TypeScript types

Add `?format=types` to a schema read
(GET /v1/schemas/{provider}/{activity}/{endpointId}) to get a self-contained
TypeScript module instead of JSON: the schema as a pure const plus generated
interfaces (`text/typescript`, zero imports, tree-shakeable, same ETag
discipline). `?optional=undefined` widens optional properties to
`T | undefined` for exactOptionalPropertyTypes consumers; default is
`foo?: T`. A request `model` field is the live catalog union plus
`ListedModelId<'provider'>` (still branded when the catalog is empty).
Minted by `listModels` / `listProviderModels` / `getModel` (or
`asListedModelId`). Arbitrary `string` values do not assign.

## Hypermedia (HAL, extended)

Every JSON read response carries `_links`: HAL link objects extended with
`method`, `contentType`, and an inline `example` (a resolvable URL for
GETs, a request body for POSTs) so you can follow the API without consulting
docs. Templated hrefs (RFC 6570) set `"templated": true` and always include
an example. Start at GET /v1 and follow `_links`.

## Long-polling

No sleep tool? Add `?wait=30` (seconds, cap 60, `30s` form accepted) to
GET /v1/changes or GET /v1/status: the request holds until new data lands or
the window expires, then returns whatever is current. One request, one
rate-limit token.

## Caching

Read responses carry ETag (content hash), Last-Modified, Cache-Control with
stale-while-revalidate, X-Fetched-At and X-Stale-At (unix epoch seconds).
Send If-None-Match to get 304s.

## Auth (optional — unlocks higher rate limits + webhooks)

- Agent-auth protocol: discovery at /.well-known/agent-configuration,
  register at POST /api/auth/agent/register, then execute capabilities with
  short-lived JWTs.
- Simple alternative: POST /v1/agents/register-key { "name" } returns an API
  key once; send it as Authorization: Bearer <key>.

## Machine-readable spec

GET /openapi.json — OpenAPI 3.1 for this service; every operation has an
operationId. GET /skill — installable agent skill (SKILL.md) teaching this
full workflow.

## Estimate usage

`usage` on POST /v1/estimate takes one of two shapes. A payload that
mixes them gets 422 mixed_usage.

- The provider's own usage object, as the API returned it: OpenAI
  Responses or Chat Completions `usage`, Anthropic `usage`, or Gemini
  `usageMetadata`. The service maps it to card levers.
- Card levers. Their counts do not overlap: `input_tokens` excludes the
  tokens in `cache_read_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens` (5-minute writes)
  and `cache_write_1h_tokens`. A card can also read `reasoning_tokens`,
  `audio_tokens`, `image_tokens` or `web_searches`; a count in one of
  these is not also in `input_tokens` or `output_tokens`. The model's
  `pricing.inputs` (GET /v1/models/{provider}/{id}) lists the levers its
  card reads.

| Native field | Card lever |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI `input_tokens` or `prompt_tokens` | `input_tokens`, less cached tokens and cache writes |
| OpenAI `*_details.cached_tokens` | `cache_read_tokens` |
| OpenAI `*_details.cache_write_tokens` | `cache_write_tokens` |
| OpenAI `prompt_tokens_details.image_tokens` | `image_tokens` when the card reads it; otherwise it stays in `input_tokens` |
| OpenAI `prompt_tokens_details.text_tokens` | not subtracted; it is already inside `prompt_tokens` |
| OpenAI `output_tokens` or `completion_tokens` | `output_tokens` |
| Anthropic `input_tokens` | `input_tokens` (already excludes cache) |
| Anthropic `cache_read_input_tokens` | `cache_read_tokens` |
| Anthropic `cache_creation_input_tokens` | `cache_write_tokens`; 1-hour writes go to `cache_write_1h_tokens` |
| Gemini `promptTokenCount` | `input_tokens`, less `cachedContentTokenCount` |
| Gemini `cachedContentTokenCount` | `cache_read_tokens` |
| Gemini `candidatesTokenCount` + `thoughtsTokenCount` | `output_tokens` |

Reasoning, audio, image and video counts move to their own lever only
when the card reads that lever. Otherwise they stay in the total, because
the source bills them at that rate. Example: gpt-5 usage
`{"input_tokens":12000,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":4000},"output_tokens":800}`
prices 8000 input, 4000 cached and 800 output tokens.

## Errors

All errors are JSON: { "error": { "code", "message" } }. Messages include
remedies (e.g. valid provider ids on a 404).
