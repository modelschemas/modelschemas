# opencode-go exact-model source silence

Checked 2026-10-09 against the native live listing, provider-owned endpoint docs,
and models.dev's own opencode-go catalog. models.dev is used only for OpenCode
Zen/Go, where it is the canonical first-party catalog. SDK package names name
protocols and do not establish another provider's request schema.

Each exception below applies only to its exact native raw id. Populated facts
remain sourced; no request field, reasoning mode, disabling flag, replay
boolean, or billed price is fabricated. Zen's explicit Free token quotes are
sourced zero prices, not source-silent exceptions. Go subscription-accounting
rates remain distinct from billed token prices.

The current chat score does not erase unknown activity on other live ids.
Native live listing: https://opencode.ai/inference/go/v1/models, the one
https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/console/go/ documents. Endpoint ids are the
models.dev `api` path plus the package suffix (`inference/go/<protocol>/...`),
checked against that page's Endpoints table (#393). Go `cost` in
https://models.dev/api.json is not stored: it is not confirmed as a billed
token price. The per-row checks below cited https://opencode.ai/docs/go,
removed upstream on 2026-10-12. Checked 2026-10-09. Rows added on
2026-10-23 cite the page that replaced it,
https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/console/go (Go $10/month, Go Plus $40/month;
token columns count against the monthly allowance). Among activity-null rows,
no own catalog record was published for: `minimax-m2.5`, `kimi-k2.5`, `glm-5.1`, `glm-5`, `deepseek-flash`, `qwen3.5-plus`, `mimo-v2-pro`, `mimo-v2-omni`, `hy3-preview`, `omen-alpha`.
Catalogued rows take their chat route from the model's package, or the provider package when the model states none.
The ten live ids absent from the public catalog remain activity-null. There is
no documented credential-gated source that supplies their missing model facts;
credentials are not substituted for the unavailable public evidence.
