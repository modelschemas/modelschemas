/**
 * Reconcile production Worker secrets against a Doppler config.
 *
 * Runs entirely on a trusted machine using credentials that are already
 * there — your Doppler CLI login and your wrangler login. Nothing new is
 * stored anywhere, no token is added to CI, and the blast radius stays
 * exactly what it is today: this laptop. That is the whole reason to prefer
 * it over a CI job, which would need a long-lived Doppler service token AND a
 * Cloudflare API token sitting in GitHub.
 *
 * Handling rules, because a careless version of this script is how secrets
 * leak:
 * - Values are held in memory only. Never written to disk, never passed as
 *   argv (visible in `ps`), never echoed. They reach wrangler over stdin.
 * - Doppler is the source of truth. Everything in the config is pushed
 *   except the remove list (`DOPPLER_*` context vars, plus
 *   `BETTER_AUTH_URL` which is already a wrangler `vars` binding).
 *   `DOPPLER_*` are not application secrets; pushing them is how the
 *   deployed Worker ended up with three junk bindings.
 * - Nothing is ever deleted. `wrangler secret bulk` can delete via null, but
 *   this script never emits one — removing a secret stays a deliberate
 *   manual act.
 * - Dry run unless `--push` is passed.
 *
 * Secrets are written into a new Worker version rather than the live one;
 * the next deploy inherits them. See the push call at the bottom for why.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/push-secrets.ts                # reconcile + report
 *   bun scripts/push-secrets.ts --push         # apply
 *   bun scripts/push-secrets.ts --config stg   # non-prod target

 * whenever the newest uploaded version is not the deployed one — the normal
 * state here, since Workers Builds uploads a preview version on every
 * non-production branch push. The versions API has no such precondition, so

 *
 * It writes the secrets into a NEW version instead of the live one, and
 * that is enough: a version inherits its bindings from the previous one, so
 * the next deploy carries these secrets forward automatically (verified on
 * this Worker — CI-uploaded versions list every secret despite CI never
 * seeing a value). Only the bindings inherit, not the code, so staging from
 * a branch cannot leak unmerged code into a later deploy.
